    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>In my personal and professional life I am working towards graduating from Highschool and furthering my education by attending college. Attending college is the most important thing in my life. I want to live a very successful life in the future so I can help my parents financially and give back to them after everything they have given me so that I could live my best life. To achieve these goals I am making sure that I am doing the best that I can right now in Highschool so I can have a good look for myself in my college applications. In college I want to major in sonography so I can hopefully become an ultra sound technician in the future. The values that I consider to be most necessary are perseverance and motivation. A lot of the time I find myself not doing homework and other things because I just don't feel like it but with the right mindset I know that I can do anything. While being motivated with schoolwork is important, being kind to people will get me further in life than anything. Some short term goals I hope to accomplish in the future is to help people. I get the most joy from seeing others smile and seeing others start to believe there is hope in the world. This summer I am traveling to Haiti with a few other people from my church for a mission trip. I hope to help them further their education and help them build a strong connection with God. The character traits I want to be most known for is my ability to make people laugh and bringing joy to those around me.</p>
